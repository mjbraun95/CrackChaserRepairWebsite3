    When the company was founded, we noticed that it was difficult to find quality fixes for a reasonable cost. Most repair work fell apart, did not last, or did not stand up to the weather. 
    </p>

    <p class="fullBox" style="margin: 0 auto;">
    Throughout our years of experience doing repair & restoration work, Crack Chaser has constantly explored the latest innovations within the industry.
